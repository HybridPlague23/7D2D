### When you start up the game, you will get a warning regarding "ANTICHEAT INCOMPATIBLE MODS", just press "OK"
### This warning is caused by the "FasterBuilding" folder because it changes some hard-coded properties. This will not impact the game negatively.

# WARNING:
## Before playing an existing world, load up a NEW world to ensure the mods are working correctly!
### Any loss of data is not my fault. Failed loading can cause your player to completely reset!
